      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Currently, I’m the Design Lead of OakNorth’s “Case Analysis” team, where we’re building data-driven tools for credit analysis and monitoring. My role is to define and validate the end-to-end experience of our customers and ensure the quality of the final software.</p>
      <p>Over the past decade, I’ve been the <em>first designer</em> of several FinTech startups. As these were early-stage companies, with no product managers, zero design maturity and sometimes even no product, I had the extraordinary opportunity to fully own every aspect of the customer experience — a huge challenge that helped me immensely to grow as a generalist designer. It also allowed me to learn how to develop a strong design culture in an organisation, to help management make better decisions with a user-centred approach, as well as to grow and mentor design teams. By becoming a key player for product development, I’ve helped these companies achieve record-breaking results and raise multi-million funding rounds.</p>
      <p>I am a self-taught and highly adaptable designer. Even after many years of career, I still like to get my hands dirty and approach every new problem with a <em>beginner’s mindset</em>, which makes me a great fit for agile and fast-paced product teams. I can work comfortably on every step of the design process, from research to prototyping, to carrying out user testing and producing detailed UIs. I also write functional requirements with product managers, work on metrics with marketing teams and collaborate on code with software engineers.</p>
      <p>What gets me excited is working on challenging design problems: turning complexity into simplicity, building sophisticated products that are easy to use, enabling people to achieve more with less effort.</p>
      <p>Other things about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Despite the name, I’m Italian 🇮🇹 Yes, I can cook quite well and no, pineapple on pizza is not acceptable.</li>
        <li>I’m a productivity nerd. I spend unreasonable amounts of time figuring out how to write more efficient notes and to-do lists.</li>
        <li>I’m a bass player 🤘 (I also play the guitar, but don’t tell anyone)</li>
      </ul>
